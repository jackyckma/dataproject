# 12-Day Milestone Project

This is a 12-Day Milestone Project for Data Incubator, which helps to practice
some important concepts and technologies, including Git, Flask, JSON, Pandas,
Requests, Heroku, and Bokeh for visualization.

The Project is deployed to Heroku at https://dataproject.herokuapp.com

## Project Requirement
- Get data from API and put it in pandas
- Use the `requests` library to grab some data from a public API. This will
  often be in JSON format, in which case `simplejson` will be useful.
- Build in some interactivity by having the user submit a form which determines which data is requested.
- Create a `pandas` dataframe with the data.
- Create a Bokeh plot from the dataframe.
- Make the plot visible on your website through embedded HTML or other methods
